## 1. Problem

PR-time coverage gating in Rust workspaces is hard for three reasons:

1. **Global thresholds are wrong for delta builds.** With impact-scoping (e.g.
   cargo-delta) a PR runs tests only for affected packages, so the overall
   coverage percentage is computed against a different denominator than the
   nightly run on `main`. A meaningful comparison requires the same denominator.
2. **Diff coverage misses real regressions.** A PR showing 90% diff coverage
   can still drop overall coverage if the displaced code was at 100%. The "did
   this PR move the codebase backwards?" question isn't answered.
3. **External services don't always reach.** Codecov is unavailable for many
   Microsoft-internal repos; Azure DevOps' native coverage UI shows totals but
   has no built-in gating mechanism that correlates with the source of truth.

The unifying observation: **the right unit for coverage policy is the package**,
not the diff, not the workspace. each package has a stable set of files and a
stable measured percentage; thresholds attached to packages remain comparable
across full and impact-scoped builds, and they catch the displaced-code case
because the per-package number drops when high-coverage code is replaced with
lower-coverage code.

## 2. Goals

1. **One opinionated gating mechanism** that works identically locally, on
   GitHub Actions, and on Azure DevOps Pipelines — no external service
   dependency.
2. **per-package thresholds** stored next to the code they describe
   (`[package.metadata.coverage-gate]` in each `Cargo.toml`).
3. **Delta-build safe**: the gate accepts a subset of packages to check, so PR
   builds running impact-scoped tests gate only against the packages whose
   tests actually ran. Each comparison stays apples-to-apples.
4. **Single visible verdict** across local CLI output, GitHub workflow
   summary, and ADO build summary tab. Reviewers see the same per-package
   table no matter where they look.
5. **Threshold lifecycle is git-native**: thresholds change via Cargo.toml
   edits that show up in PR diffs — no hidden state, no separate baseline
   service.
6. **Open source**: ships from `github.com/microsoft/ox-tools` to crates.io.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Running tests or producing coverage data. The tool consumes the lcov
  tracefile produced by [`cargo-llvm-cov`][cargo-llvm-cov]; it does not
  invoke the toolchain itself.
- Diff coverage (per-line annotation of changed lines). Different concern,
  different consumers (review tooling like Codecov); this tool answers a
  separable question.
- Uploading coverage to Codecov / ADO Coverage UI. Those uploads use the
  byte-exact lcov / cobertura files cargo-llvm-cov emits and are wired by
  the surrounding CI templates. This tool stays out of upload paths.
- Cross-crate aggregation policies (e.g. "workspace total must stay above
  N"). If a repo wants that, run the existing
  `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines` flag in parallel; the two are
  independent.
- Mixed-language coverage (C/C++ + Rust). `cargo-llvm-cov` doesn't support
  it either; repos that need it switch to `grcov` and out of this tool's
  scope.

## 4. Guiding Principle

> **one package, one number, one threshold, one verdict.**

Corollaries:

- Each workspace member gets an effective threshold via the
  three-layer resolution (per-package → workspace → built-in `100.0`).
  Opting a package out of gating is explicit: set `min-lines-percent = 0.0`.
  A package that legitimately has **no coverable lines** instead declares
  `expect-no-coverable-lines = true` — a self-validating assertion that
  passes while the package stays empty and fails if coverable lines
  appear (see §5.3).
- The gate compares **measured percentage for package X against the threshold
  for package X**, in isolation. There is no cross-package dependency.
- Whether the build that produced the coverage data ran one package's tests
  or all of them does not affect the verdict logic — only which packages are
  in scope.

## 5. User Experience

### 5.1 Installation

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-coverage-gate
```

Required at PR time on CI runners and (optionally) on developer machines that
want to reproduce the gate locally.

### 5.2 CLI surface

```text
cargo coverage-gate  [--lcov <path>]... [-p <spec>]... [--package <spec>]...
                     [--summary-file <path>] [--quiet]
```

A single command — no subcommands. The tool reads one or more cargo-llvm-cov
lcov tracefiles (merging them at the line level), resolves the effective per-package threshold (per-package metadata,
then workspace default, then the built-in default of `100.0`), computes
per-package percentages, and emits a verdict table. Exit `0` if every
in-scope package meets its threshold; exit `1` if any in-scope package
fails; exit `2` on configuration error.

Flags:

- `--lcov <path>` — path to a cargo-llvm-cov lcov tracefile. May be
  repeated (`--lcov a.info --lcov b.info`); the tracefiles are merged at
  the line level (per-line counts summed, line sets combined) before
  gating, so multiple feature-config exports (`--all-features`,
  `--no-default-features`) can be gated together without a separate,
  platform-specific merge step (`lcov -a` is Linux-only). Defaults to a
  single `target/coverage/lcov.info` when omitted (matching the
  recommended `cargo llvm-cov report --lcov --output-path <path>`
  invocation).
- `-p` / `--package <spec>` — restrict the operation to one or more
  package selectors. Accepts the same idiom as `cargo build`: repeat
  the flag (`-p foo -p bar`) and/or use Unix shell glob patterns
  (`-p 'tokio-*'`, `-p '*macros'`). Default: every workspace
  member. CI integrations pass the impacted-package list from their
  test-impact step so that impact-scoped runs only gate the packages
  whose tests actually ran. A selector that matches no member is a
  configuration error (exit 2).
- `--summary-file <path>` — write a Markdown verdict table to this file.
  When unset, the tool honors the environment variables
  `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` (GitHub Actions) and
  `COVERAGE_GATE_SUMMARY` (any CI that pipes the file content through
  `##vso[task.uploadsummary]` or equivalent) automatically.
- `--quiet` — suppress stdout output (the summary file, if any, is still
  written).

The tool never writes to `Cargo.toml`. All threshold values are set by
hand, so every change appears in a PR diff and is reviewed.

### 5.3 The threshold metadata

A package's threshold is resolved in three layers, in priority order:

1. **per-package**: `[package.metadata.coverage-gate]` in the package's
   `Cargo.toml`.
2. **Workspace default**: `[workspace.metadata.coverage-gate]` in the
   root `Cargo.toml`. Applies to every member without per-package
   metadata.
3. **Built-in default**: `min-lines-percent = 100.0`. Applied when neither of
   the above is present.

```toml
# per-package (highest priority):
[package.metadata.coverage-gate]
min-lines-percent = 75.0
```

```toml
# Workspace-wide default (applies to all members that don't override):
[workspace.metadata.coverage-gate]
min-lines-percent = 80.0
```

The schema today is one key, `min-lines-percent`, an integer or float percentage
(`0.0`–`100.0` inclusive). Future extensions can add `min-functions`,
`min-regions` symmetrically.

The built-in default of `100.0` means **gating is on by default**: a new
package with no metadata anywhere will only pass if every measured line is
covered. To opt a package out of gating, set `min-lines-percent = 0.0` explicitly
(at the package or workspace level). There is no implicit opt-out.

#### `expect-no-coverable-lines`: empty crates vs. opt-out

`min-lines-percent = 0.0` is a deliberately loose opt-out: "I don't
require any coverage for this package." It says nothing about whether the
package *has* coverable code — it always passes, and it suppresses the
no-data configuration error (§6.3) so a package no test binary touches
still passes. That conflates two distinct intents:

- **"This package is not covered by tests"** — it has real, executable
  code, we simply choose not to gate it. `min-lines-percent = 0.0`.
- **"This package has no coverable lines at all"** — pure re-exports,
  trait/type definitions, a thin `main` shim, a build-script-only crate.
  There is genuinely nothing to cover, and that fact should be asserted
  and re-checked, not silently waved through.

For the second intent, declare it explicitly:

```toml
[package.metadata.coverage-gate]
expect-no-coverable-lines = true
```

Semantics:

- The package **passes** as long as it has zero coverable lines (which
  includes the "no attributed coverage data at all" case — that is the
  expected state, not the §6.3 configuration error).
- If coverable lines ever appear, the package **fails the gate**
  (exit `1`), exactly like a coverage regression. The author either
  removes the code, or — if the new code is meant to stay — replaces the
  assertion with a real `min-lines-percent` floor in the same PR. The
  change is visible in the diff and reviewed.

This is the key difference from `min-lines-percent = 0.0`: the assertion
is **self-validating**. `0.0` keeps passing forever no matter what the
package grows into; `expect-no-coverable-lines = true` actively re-checks
the claim on every run.

Rules:

- `expect-no-coverable-lines` is **package-scoped only**. Setting it in
  `[workspace.metadata.coverage-gate]` is a configuration error (exit
  `2`) — a workspace-wide "no coverable lines" default is nonsensical.
- It is **mutually exclusive** with `min-lines-percent` on the same
  package: setting both is a configuration error (exit `2`). A numeric
  floor describes code that should be covered; the assertion declares
  there is no such code.
- A non-boolean value is a configuration error (exit `2`). An explicit
  `false` is identical to omitting the key.

### 5.4 The verdict table

The tool prints a table to stdout (and to the summary file when
configured). The output is deterministic: byte-identical input
produces byte-identical output, so diffs across runs are stable.

```text
coverage-gate

  Package  Lines       Threshold   Δ vs threshold   Status   Source
  ───────  ──────────  ──────────  ───────────────  ───────  ─────────
  alpha    82.1%        80.0%        +2.1pp           OK       package
  beta     74.5%        80.0%        −5.5pp           FAIL     workspace
  gamma    91.0%       100.0%        −9.0pp           FAIL     default
  ───────  ──────────  ──────────  ───────────────  ───────  ─────────
  Result: 2 package(s) below threshold.
```

The `Source` column reports which layer supplied the threshold: `package`,
`workspace`, or `default` (the built-in `100.0`).

The `Status` column is `OK` / `FAIL` for normally-gated packages,
`NO DATA` for a gated package with no attributed coverage data (a
configuration error, §6.3), and — for packages declaring
`expect-no-coverable-lines` (§5.3) — `EMPTY` when the assertion holds
(passing) or `NOT EMPTY` when coverable lines were found (failing). For
the `EMPTY` / `NOT EMPTY` rows the `Threshold` and `Δ vs threshold`
columns render `(no lines)` and `—`, since there is no percentage floor.

Markdown variant uses the same columns and a leading `### coverage-gate`
header so it renders cleanly in GitHub job summaries and ADO build summaries.

### 5.5 Local invocation

```sh
# Wipe any stale coverage data so the run reflects only this invocation.
cargo llvm-cov clean --workspace
# Run coverage tests (cargo-llvm-cov produces target/coverage/lcov.info).
cargo llvm-cov nextest --workspace --all-features --locked --no-report
cargo llvm-cov report --lcov --output-path target/coverage/lcov.info

# Apply the gate.
cargo coverage-gate
```

Both commands chain naturally and can be wrapped in a single recipe by
whatever task-runner the repo uses (`just`, `make`, `cargo xtask`, …).

## 6. Inputs & Outputs in Detail

### 6.1 The cargo-llvm-cov lcov tracefile

`cargo llvm-cov report --lcov` emits the [LCOV tracefile][lcov]
format. The tool reads its per-source-file sections:

```text
TN:
SF:/abs/.../crates/alpha/src/lib.rs
DA:1,5
DA:2,3
DA:3,0
...
LF:100
LH:82
end_of_record
```

For each `SF:` section the tool counts:

- `lines_total` — number of distinct `DA:` records (executable lines
  the instrumentation knows about).
- `lines_covered` — number of those with a non-zero hit count.

Records other than `SF:` / `DA:` / `LF:` / `LH:` (function `FN:`,
branch `BRDA:`, etc.) are accepted by the parser but not used; the
gate is a line-coverage tool.

#### Multiple tracefiles

`--lcov` may be supplied more than once. The tool parses each tracefile
and merges them at the line level **before** computing per-package
aggregates: per-line hit counts are summed and the `DA:` line set is the
union across inputs, so a line is `covered` if it was hit in *any* input.
This is exactly the merge `cargo-llvm-cov` performs internally on its
`.profraw` set, so passing the `--all-features` and
`--no-default-features` exports here yields the same per-package line
coverage as a single merged report. The motivation is to avoid a separate
merge step in the producing recipe: `cargo-llvm-cov`'s union *report*
step shells one `--object=` per test binary and overflows the Windows
`CreateProcess` command-line limit on large workspaces, while the
Linux-only `lcov -a` merger is not portable. Letting the gate consume the
two per-config exports directly sidesteps both.

#### Why lcov, not the JSON

`cargo-llvm-cov` can also export the same data as JSON v2/v3, cobertura
XML, or Codecov's custom JSON. We pick lcov because it matches every
other coverage UI fed by the same data:

- Codecov ingests lcov uploads directly.
- ADO ingests cobertura, which cargo-llvm-cov derives from lcov
  internally (same line set).
- `cargo llvm-cov report --codecov` emits Codecov's custom JSON, also
  derived from lcov.

The JSON export uses a stricter line-coverage semantics ("every region
on a line must be hit"); lcov uses the lenient "any region hit" rule
that everything else understands. Picking lcov keeps the gate's
numbers aligned with what adopters see in codecov / ADO when they
calibrate their `min-lines-percent` thresholds.

The tool computes its own per-package aggregates so that
`--package` filtering, plus any `--ignore-filename-regex` passed
upstream to cargo-llvm-cov, doesn't desync from the displayed verdict.

### 6.2 File-to-package attribution

For each `SF:` path in the tracefile, the tool determines which
workspace member owns it by **longest-prefix match** against the
workspace members' manifest directories as reported by `cargo metadata`
(no further canonicalization is performed; the matcher trusts the
metadata-reported paths). A file under
`workspace_root/crates/alpha/src/lib.rs` belongs to the member whose
manifest is `workspace_root/crates/alpha/Cargo.toml`.

Files that match no member (typically generated code outside the workspace
tree, sysroot files like `std`/`core` that leaked into the report, or
proc-macro expansions with synthesized paths) are dropped with a single
aggregated warning per run (one line, total count, not per-file), so
constant low-volume noise stays bounded. They are not folded into any
package's totals.

### 6.3 Aggregation

Per package, the tool sums `lines.count` and `lines.covered` over every
attributed file, then computes percentage as
`100.0 * sum(covered) / sum(count)`.

A package that is in the gated set (either listed in `--package`, or
implicitly via the default of "every workspace member") but has **zero
attributed files** in the lcov tracefile is a configuration error: it
means no test binary that touched that package's source actually ran.
The tool reports such packages in the table as `(no data)` and exits
with code `2`. This converts a silent gap — a typo in `--package`,
a broken impact tool, a `--ignore-filename-regex` mismatch — into a
loud failure that surfaces immediately in CI.

The exception is a package that declares `expect-no-coverable-lines =
true` (§5.3): for that package, zero attributed lines is the *expected*
state and classifies as a pass (`EMPTY` / `➖`), not the no-data
configuration error. Conversely, if such a package *does* have attributed
coverable lines, it fails the gate (exit `1`) rather than passing.

### 6.4 Cross-package test attribution

Per-package aggregation groups measurements by **source-file ownership**
(longest-prefix match against workspace member paths), but the
measurements themselves are produced by **whichever test binaries
executed**. In a workspace those two views diverge: package `B`'s
integration tests can — and routinely do — exercise package `A`'s public
API, and the lines marked covered are then attributed to `A` even
though the test that produced them lives in `B`.

This matters at PR time under impact scoping. Consider:

1. **PR1** modifies `A` and `B`. The impact-scoped run includes both,
   so `B`'s integration tests run and incidentally cover much of `A`.
   `A`'s measured percentage is high; the author commits a high
   `min-lines-percent` for `A`.
2. **PR2** modifies only `A`. If the impact-scoped run includes only
   `A`'s own tests, `A`'s measured percentage drops sharply — not
   because `A` regressed, but because the test binary that contributed
   most of `A`'s coverage didn't run. The gate fails for reasons the
   author cannot fix in this PR.

The fix is a **contract on the impact tool**, not on the gate:

> **For every package `X` in the impacted set, the impact tool must also
> include every package that depends on `X` (directly or transitively,
> through normal, dev, and build dependencies), so that every test
> binary capable of exercising `X` runs.**

This is the reverse-dependency closure. Most impact tools — including
`cargo-delta` — already compute it, because they have to in order to
catch downstream breakage from API changes. The argument that it
suffices for coverage is the same: the only way another package's tests
can contribute coverage to `X` is if those tests link against `X`,
which requires a (transitive) dependency edge from that package to `X`.
The reverse-dep closure includes every such package by construction, so
the set of test binaries that exercise `X` is the same in PR1 and PR2,
and so is `X`'s measured percentage.

The tool cannot verify the contract directly — the lcov tracefile
doesn't record which test binaries ran. The mitigation is the §6.3
rule above: a package listed in `--package` but with no attributed files
is treated as a configuration error, so the most common
contract-violating shape (the impact tool omits A package's
reverse-dep that owns the only test binary covering it) surfaces as a
hard failure rather than a quietly mis-gated number.

Repos that do not impact-scope their coverage runs are unaffected:
running every test binary every time trivially satisfies the contract.

One residual case is intentional, not a bug: a PR that *removes* a
test in `B` which had been covering parts of `A` will cause `A`'s
measured percentage to drop, and the gate will fail on `A`. This is
exactly the displaced-coverage case the gate is designed to catch
(§1.2). The author either restores equivalent coverage, lowers `A`'s
threshold in the same PR (visible in the diff), or finds another way
to cover the affected paths.

### 6.5 Markdown output

Markdown rendering uses GitHub-flavored tables, which both
`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and ADO's `task.uploadsummary` render correctly:

```markdown
### coverage-gate

| Package | Lines  | Threshold | Δ vs threshold | Status | Source     |
|---------|-------:|----------:|---------------:|:------:|:-----------|
| alpha   | 82.1%  | 80.0%     | +2.1pp         | ✅     | package    |
| beta    | 74.5%  | 80.0%     | −5.5pp         | ❌     | workspace  |
| gamma   | 91.0%  | 100.0%    | −9.0pp         | ❌     | default    |

**Result:** 2 packages below threshold.
```

## 7. Threshold Lifecycle

### 7.1 Adoption

A new repo adopts the gate by enabling `cargo coverage-gate` in CI and
watching the first run fail loudly. every package inherits the built-in
default of `100.0`, so until the maintainer says otherwise, every package
is required to be fully covered.

To shape the policy, the maintainer either:

- sets a `[workspace.metadata.coverage-gate]` default for the repo,
- adds per-package `[package.metadata.coverage-gate]` overrides for
  packages whose realistic floor differs, or
- explicitly opts packages out with `min-lines-percent = 0.0`, or
  declares genuinely empty packages with
  `expect-no-coverable-lines = true` (§5.3).

All three live in `Cargo.toml` files, so the policy lands as a normal
reviewed change. From that point on, every PR runs the gate.

### 7.2 Intentional improvement

After a PR meaningfully improves coverage in some package, the maintainer
ratchets the threshold up by editing the relevant `min-lines-percent` value in
`Cargo.toml` (per-package or workspace-level). The change appears in the
PR diff and is reviewed alongside the code that justifies it.

There is intentionally no automated "ratchet" command: every threshold
change — up or down — is a code-reviewed edit, so the policy and the
code that satisfies it land together and stay together in the git log.

### 7.3 Regression

A PR that drops a package's coverage below its threshold fails the gate.
The author either:

- Improves test coverage in that package to clear the threshold, **or**
- Edits `min-lines-percent` downward in the same PR, making the lowered floor
  visible in the PR diff. The reviewer judges whether the lowering is
  acceptable.

There is no mechanism for "temporarily skip this gate" — the second option
is the intentional way to bypass, and it leaves a permanent record.

### 7.4 package addition and removal

A new package added in a PR inherits the workspace default (or the
built-in `100.0` if no workspace default is set). To set a different
floor, the same PR adds `[package.metadata.coverage-gate]` to the new
package's `Cargo.toml`. A removed package's threshold disappears with its
`Cargo.toml`; the gate ignores it automatically.

## 8. CI Integration

### 8.1 GitHub Actions

The intended call site is from a reusable workflow that already publishes
the lcov / cobertura artifacts. After the test step:

```yaml
- name: Coverage gate
  shell: bash
  run: cargo coverage-gate $PACKAGE_FLAGS
```

`$PACKAGE_FLAGS` is whatever the surrounding pipeline produces from its
test-impact step (e.g., from `cargo-delta` or an equivalent), formatted
as repeated `-p` arguments (`-p alpha -p beta`). If you don't do impact
scoping, drop the variable and gate every workspace member every run.

The job picks up `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` automatically and writes the
verdict table to the workflow-run page above the job log.

### 8.2 Azure DevOps

```yaml
- bash: |
    summary="$(mktemp).md"
    cargo coverage-gate \
        $(PACKAGE_FLAGS) \
        --summary-file "$summary"
    echo "##vso[task.uploadsummary]$summary"
  displayName: Coverage gate
```

The summary file is uploaded as a tab on the build run, alongside the
existing "Code Coverage" tab. The job's exit code is set by
`cargo coverage-gate`, so the build fails when any package is below
threshold.

### 8.3 Coexistence with native UIs

The tool gates; Codecov and ADO Coverage UI continue to handle navigation
(which lines, which files, trends). They may show warnings on
workspace-aggregate drops the tool doesn't gate against; users who want
those warnings gating set the corresponding status check as required in
branch protection / branch policy. The gate is the source of truth for
the per-package verdict; the native UIs are the source of truth for
line-level navigation.

## 9. Customization

Three escape valves, in increasing severity:

1. **Set, raise, or remove `min-lines-percent`** in A package's `Cargo.toml`. The
   normal flow.
2. **Limit scope with `--package`** to gate only a subset of packages per
   run. Useful for impact-scoped builds; the CI templates use this by
   default.
3. **Stop running the gate.** Remove the `cargo coverage-gate` step
   from the CI template. The thresholds in `Cargo.toml`s remain as
   static documentation; nothing enforces them.

## 10. Cross-cutting Concerns

### 10.1 Determinism

per-package aggregation must produce the same percentage byte-for-byte given
the same lcov input, regardless of file iteration order. This holds for
free because the aggregation step sums integer line counters (commutative
and associative), and the f64 percentage is computed once at the end.
The displayed value rounds to one decimal place (matching
cargo-llvm-cov's default text-summary precision), and the pass/fail
comparison rounds to the same precision before comparing — see
§10.5 for the rationale.

### 10.2 Security

The tool reads `Cargo.toml` files and a coverage lcov tracefile. It never
writes; the only output channels are stdout and the optional summary
file. No network access, no privileged operations. The only subprocess
invocation is the read-only `cargo metadata` call performed by
`cargo_metadata::MetadataCommand::exec()` during workspace discovery
(used to enumerate workspace members and resolve the workspace root).

### 10.3 Monorepo / multi-workspace

v1 supports one workspace per invocation, located by walking up from
CWD to the nearest `Cargo.toml` with a `[workspace]` table. Repos with
multiple workspaces invoke the tool once per workspace.

### 10.4 lcov tracefile compatibility

The LCOV tracefile format has no version number. It is a line-oriented
record format that has been stable across the LCOV project for over a
decade, with new record types added over time (function `FN:` /
`FNDA:`, branch `BRDA:`, etc.). The tool reads only `SF:` (source
file) and `DA:` (line count) records; everything else is ignored, so
new record types added by future cargo-llvm-cov releases will not
break parsing.

If a tracefile contains no `SF:` sections — empty file, or a corrupted
upload — the tool exits with a configuration error (no files attributed
to any package). Structural parse errors (e.g., malformed `DA:`
records) are hard errors with exit code 2.

#### Tooling requirements

To get faithful numbers, run the tracefile-producing step on **nightly
Rust with `cargo-llvm-cov ≥ 0.7`**. Two reasons:

- `#[coverage(off)]` is gated behind `feature(coverage_attribute)`,
  which is nightly-only. On stable, files annotated with
  `#[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]` are still measured
  and any uncovered match arms / test code inflate the denominator.
- cargo-llvm-cov 0.6.x did not propagate `#[coverage(off)]` into its
  JSON / lcov output even on nightly. Versions 0.7+ fix this. Older
  versions silently report inflated line counts, which then surface
  as low percentages in the gate.

### 10.5 Float comparison

Percentage comparisons round both sides to the displayed precision (one
decimal place) before comparing: `round(pct * 10) >= round(threshold * 10)`.
This guarantees the rendered "Δ vs threshold" column always agrees with the
pass/fail verdict — anything that prints as ≥ the threshold passes,
anything that prints as below it fails. There is no separate tolerance
constant to tune.

## 11. Out-of-Scope, Possible Extensions

These are intentionally not part of v1; called out so the design doesn't
preclude them.

- **Function and region thresholds** in parallel to `min-lines-percent`. Same
  data, additive keys, no architectural change.
- **cobertura input** in addition to the cargo-llvm-cov lcov tracefile.
  cargo-llvm-cov derives cobertura from the same lcov data, so the
  numbers would be identical; a small parser wrapper if a real need
  surfaces.
- **Per-file thresholds.** Rejected for v1: at the file level, thresholds
  become noisy and brittle (renames, splits, new files). the package is
  the right granularity unit.
- **Reporting the absolute number of lines** (covered/total) alongside
  the percentage. Useful for small packages where 1 line moves the
  percentage by 10pp. Could be a `--verbose` flag.
- **Optional baseline tracefile for delta display**. The gate is comparing
  observed vs. threshold, not observed vs. previous-run, by design.
